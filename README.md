An example project that uses [Proactive]; an application property generator framework that validates your property values on runtime.

### What are you looking at?

This is a demo project for the framework [Propactive](https://github.com/propactive/propactive#readme). It demonstrates the ability to:
  - Create properties file using the JVM in a flexible manner.
  - Control which properties files to generate.
  - Plus validate property files on runtime with custom types.

The benefit of such approach is evident for enterprise microservices
that rely on multiple properties and are deployed to different environments.

For further details, see: [Propactive Framework's README](https://github.com/propactive/propactive#readme)
